GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
• Working Directory: umberella term for files and folders
• Staging Area: files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit.
• Local Repo (head): head local repo is the place we are actively making changes to our code and is typically housed on the computer.
• Remote repo (master): repository on the server that has the primary version of source code


WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:
• Staged:one of three places that code can be stored but is between the orking directory and repository
• Modified: when the working directory experiences changes
• Committed: when the working directory changes are saved

• Git merge: combines multiple sequences of commits into one 
• Git pull: fetches and downloads content from a remote repository and immediately updates the local repository to match
