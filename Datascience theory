Theory questions	10 point each

1.	What does “Data Cleansing” mean? What are the best ways to practice this?
Data cleansing involves a combination of:
•	removing data
•	fixing spelling and syntax errors
•	standardizing data sets
•	fixing missing codes and empty fields
•	identifying duplicate records.

2.	What is the difference between data profiling and data mining?
Data profiling is examining an existing database for data quality to discover anomalies
turn raw data into useful information
Data mining uses mathematical algorithms to examine the data and interpret the data

3.	Define Outlier with an example.
A data point that lies abnormally outside the rest of the dataset samples

4.	What is “Collaborative Filtering”?
A method that makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating)

5.	What is “Time Series Analysis”?
Analyzes a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time

6.	Explain the core steps of a Data Analysis project?
•	Define goal
•	Get data
•	Clean data
•	Enrich data
•	Find insights  and visualize
•	Deploy machine learning
•	iterate

7.	What are the characteristics of a good data model?
It easily consumes the data, it’s large datasets are scalable, it has predictable performance and is adaptable

8.	Explain and provide examples of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis?
Univariate, bivariate and multivariate are the analyses of a single, double and multiple variable(s), respectively
Examples: 
Univariate: Area = of a square with variable r
Bivariate: BMI depends on weight and height
Multivariate:  Volume of a rectangular solid= length x width x height

9.	What is a Linear Regression?
Linear regression utilizes  the relationship between data-points to draw a straight line through all them with the idea of being able to predict a continuous value based on its input variables. In python, this can be done using the Scipy library

10.	In terms of modelling data, what do we mean by Over-fitting and Under-fitting?
Overfitting happens when the training data model performs well on the training data but does not perform well on the evaluation data
Underfitting happens when the training data model performs poorly on the training data.
